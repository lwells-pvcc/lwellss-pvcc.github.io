            <p>The internet has changed our world in so many revolutionary ways. Giving us vital health and medical care, increasing sociability and family relationships, and effective communication through message on hand. Also, the internet has brought us social media and more outlets of entertainment as a whole. As a person who is avidly on the internet, being able to play games and scroll on social media is extremely satisfying. Most important of all, these outlets of entertainment have led to so many different sources of income for millions of people across the world. Given the access and reliability to open your phone or laptop and instantly being able to access different streams of income is life changing and generational. The internet has proven itself to be undeniably efficient, innovative, and life changing. So, maintaining the correct coverage of our creation will produce only good moving forward. We as people need to collaborate and sustain efficiency within the internet.  </p>

            <h2>Negative Impacts</h2>

            <p>Despite its benefits, the internet has challenges such as internet addiction, privacy and security issues, and health issues that result from excessive screen time. As eye grabbing as the internet can be, it can be so addictive. For example, lots of screen time on social media can lead to decreased productivity and the want of being isolated from society. Which can ultimately progress into signs of depression and disassociation with reality itself. Along with social media, gaming addictions are a widespread epidemic. Spending countless hours close to a screen and not taking any breaks can lead to detrimental side effects. Those being sleep deprivation, vision problems, wrist injuries (such as carpal tunnel), and irritability. Privacy and security are another issue of the Internet that has its flaws. Constant data breaches and identity theft are but just two issues. Another issue is the spread of misinformation, where false or misleading content is shared widely, influencing public opinion and even political decisions. Hackers having the ability to steal financial and personal information while they have the intent of misusing it is catastrophic for all users. Without taking the proper precautions, the internet can become out of hand, and we will risk the chance of losing complete control. With these issues being as consistent as they are, I believe with the correct initiative and responsibility from both the creators and users the internet can be tamed.      </p>

            <h2>The Future and Impact on the Users of the Internet</h2>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/rightyaleft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/future-of-internet.jpg"Online Image">
            <p>With advancements in AI, the internet is expected to become more secure, intelligent, and accessible to all. The coming 6G networks, the progression of satellite internet, and the closing of digital divide are upon us. AI progression could do wonders and wrongs for all users. AI cybersecurity could eventually secure users for identity theft and cyberattacks completely, but also while being able to complete such a task it could displace millions of jobs from users whose task were identical. Which could lead to outrage from workers and potentially cause riots or protest. While AI has its pros and cons, the Metaverse would be gradually improving as well. Virtual reality and Augmented Reality would become fully immersive. Having the ability to create virtual workplaces, shopping options, and day to day education. Which could make doing this daily task more engaging. Additionally, the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) will result in an increasingly connected world, where everyday objects communicate with each other and users.  While that can be good, it can lead to mental health problems and addiction. The future of the internet will be quicker, intelligent, and immersive. But the key to bettering the internet for the future would have to be prioritizing the important things such as responsibility, cybersecurity, and mental health. All of which with attentive care and consistency, can help control a positive output from the internet moving forward.  </p>
